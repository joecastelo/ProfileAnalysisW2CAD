# ProfileAnalysisW2CAD
Extract Flatness and Symmetry from Profiles W2CAD extracted from Beam Configuration
## Select File W2CAD, From Measured Profiles in Beam Configuration, pressing File-> Export -> Data to w2cad (  measured profiles from Beam Configuration)

##### Beam symmetry (10x10 cm) Find the 50 % and get the areas $$ S = 100 . \frac{area_n - area_r}{area_n + area_r} $$

##### Beam Flatness, 80 % of the Field Size (Largest Field Size) $$  F = 100. \frac{D_{max} - D_{min}}{D_{max} + D_{min}} $$
